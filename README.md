## Repository Overview
The main content of this repository is a Jupyter Notebook titled `Computing Vision - Basics`. This notebook covers several fundamental operations in computer vision using Python and OpenCV, including:

- Basic image operations (loading, displaying, resizing, and converting images)
- Image pre-processing techniques (edge detection, smoothing, thresholding)
- Advanced operations (morphological transformations, feature extraction)
- Image correction and segmentation methods

The notebook is structured to provide a hands-on approach, making it ideal for beginners and enthusiasts looking to understand the basics of computer vision.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or open it in an online Jupyter environment.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy) installed.
3. Run the notebook to see the computer vision techniques in action.
